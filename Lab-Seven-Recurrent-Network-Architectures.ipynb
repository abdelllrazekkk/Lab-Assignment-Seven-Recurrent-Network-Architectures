    "From the public domain of Kaggle, we import this dataset that we think is most convinient for this lab pruproses. This was a dataaset created as a part of a university Project On Sentimental Analysis On Multi-Source Social Media Platform. These tweets were made on Narendra Modi and other Leaders as well as People's opinion towards the next Prime Minister of The Nation (In Context with General Elections Held In India - 2019). This dataset consists of around 163K tweets from the social media platform Twitter, it has two cloumns, the first column has the cleaned tweets and Comments and the Second one indicates its Sentimental Label. with Sentimental Label in the form:\n",

    "We can create a business goal for this dataset in the following way: say we are hired by Twitter to speed up their detection for tweets that violate policies and rules. We expect tweets that have a positive sentiment and neutral tweets in general to not be violating the policies, however, negative tweets are more likely to contain words that are inappropriate and violate the codes of the platform. Thus, this classification will help in detecting the tweets that are more likely to be violating the codes of the platform (the negative tweets), and we end up with a binary classification problem more or less.\n",

    "Below we define a function called create_RNN() that takes in several arguments, including a name for the RNN model, the RNN_layer_type (either 'LSTM' or 'GRU'), the number of num_units, and an embedding_layer. The function uses the RNN_layer_type argument to determine which type of RNN layer to use in the model (either LSTM or GRU). It then creates a new Sequential model with the specified name and adds the embedding_layer and RNN layer to it. The RNN layer has 100 units and uses a dropout rate of 0.2. The function then adds a dense output layer with NUM_CLASSES output units and a sigmoid activation function, and compiles the model using the 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function and the 'rmsprop' optimizer. Finally, the function returns the compiled RNN model\n",

Thus, after several attempts, I found that keeping the number of layers at around 100 prevented overfitting the best. The dropout rate is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out a portion of the units during training. A dropout rate of 0.2 means that 20% of the units will be dropped out during each training step. I found that any higher dropout caused generalizations to the new data to not match as well, so 20% stayed pretty consistent, while still allowing it to adapt. "
